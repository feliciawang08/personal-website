# personal-website
Personal website I'm working on using Python's Flask :) (WIP!)

**Note: Navbar as shown on live website does not match what is shown on locally hosted site. The text is supposed to be black and centered left for all pages.**
**Additionally, while the contact form works perfectly fine locally, it does not seem to work live.**
